The project explores two datasets containing mental health scores, habits, music preferences, and demographic information. The goal is to understand the relationships between mental health variables and lifestyle choices using:

- **Statistical Hypothesis Testing:** Independent t-tests, Pearson correlation  
- **Regression Models:** Simple Linear Regression, Logistic Regression  
- **Clustering:** KMeans, K-Medoids  
- **Hierarchical Clustering:** Dendrograms  
- **Classification:** Naive Bayes Classifier  
- **Data Visualization:** Distribution plots, correlation heatmaps, and dashboards  

## Datasets  
- `mental_health_analysis.csv`: Demographics, mental health scores, academic performance  
- `mxmh_survey_results.csv`: Music habits, anxiety, depression, insomnia, OCD  

### Hypothesis Testing & t-Tests  
- Compare means between groups using independent t-tests (e.g., Anxiety by Gender, OCD by Academic Performance).  
- Test the null hypothesis that group means are equal.  
- Calculate t-statistics and p-values to assess statistical significance.  
- Visualize results with t-distribution plots showing critical regions and test statistics.

### Pearson Correlation Analysis  
- Measure strength and direction of linear relationships between continuous variables using Pearson’s r.  
- Interpret positive, negative, or no correlation between variables such as Exercise Hours and Sleep Hours.  
- Visualize with correlation heatmaps and scatterplots.

### Basic Regression, Classification & Clustering  
- Simple linear and logistic regression models demonstrating relationships and predictions.  
- Introductory Naive Bayes classification and K-means/K-medoids clustering to group data points.  
- Minimal plots to illustrate model results

## Visualizations & Insights

- **Average Anxiety and Depression by Favorite Music Genre**  
  Shows how anxiety and depression levels vary by music preference. Genres like *Lofi* and *Hip hop* correlate with higher averages.

- **Sum of Mental Health Conditions**  
  Stacked bar chart comparing total cases of anxiety, OCD, insomnia, and depression across the dataset.

- **Average Exercise Hours by Stress Level and Support System**  
  Analyzes how physical activity varies with stress and emotional support levels. More support correlates with steadier exercise habits.

- **Social Media Usage by Gender and Support System**  
  Highlights total social media usage hours by gender and support system level. Useful for understanding digital behavior patterns.

- **Count of Users by Age**  
  Bar chart showing the age distribution of survey participants (13–18 years old).

- **Count of Users by Gender**  
  Compares total male and female participants.

- **Gender Count by Stress Score and Academic Performance**  
  Breaks down stress levels across academic performance groups, segmented by gender.

- **Age Distribution by Gender**  
  Explores how male and female respondents are distributed across different ages.

- **Count of Composers by Favorite Genre**  
  Reveals how musical genre preference varies among respondents who compose music.

- **Count of Instrumentalists by Favorite Genre**  
  Similar to the above, focused on users who play instruments.

- **Academic Performance Breakdown by Gender**  
  Displays average academic scores for each gender across performance levels.

- **Support System vs. Academic Performance**  
  Cross-tabulation of support levels and academic outcomes to examine their relationship.

- **Mental Health Averages by Genre**  
  Table showing average scores of anxiety, depression, OCD, and insomnia per music genre.

- **Survey Stress Score by Support System**  
  Shows how support level affects reported stress (1–5 scale).

- **Count of Users by Academic Performance**  
  Displays total users by academic category.

- **Users by Support System and Stress Level**  
  Grouped bar chart showing how stress levels are distributed across support system levels.
