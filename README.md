This project explores two datasets containing mental health scores, lifestyle habits, music preferences, and demographic information. The goal is to understand the relationships between mental health variables and lifestyle choices using:

- **Statistical Hypothesis Testing:** Independent t-tests, Pearson correlation  
- **Regression Models:** Simple Linear Regression, Logistic Regression  
- **Clustering:** KMeans, K-Medoids  
- **Hierarchical Clustering:** Dendrograms  
- **Classification:** Naive Bayes Classifier  
- **Data Visualization:** Distribution plots, correlation heatmaps, and dashboards  

## Datasets  
- `mental_health_analysis.csv`: Demographics, mental health scores, academic performance  
- `mxmh_survey_results.csv`: Music habits, anxiety, depression, insomnia, OCD  

### Hypothesis Testing & t-Tests  
- Compare means between groups using independent t-tests (e.g., Anxiety by Gender, OCD by Academic Performance).  
- Test the null hypothesis that group means are equal.  
- Calculate t-statistics and p-values to assess statistical significance.  
- Visualize results with t-distribution plots showing critical regions and test statistics.

### Pearson Correlation Analysis  
- Measure strength and direction of linear relationships between continuous variables using Pearsonâ€™s r.  
- Interpret positive, negative, or no correlation between variables such as Exercise Hours and Sleep Hours.  
- Visualize with correlation heatmaps and scatterplots.
